     Given The publication issue has most of its pages
     And there are pages that have missing sequence numbering
     And the processing rule indicates that missing sequences are treated as errors
     But the page following or preceding the missing page is double the width and the same height as the page following
     or preceding that page
     When the publication issue is processed
