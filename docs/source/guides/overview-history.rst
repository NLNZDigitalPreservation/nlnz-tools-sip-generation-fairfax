Overview
========

NLNZ Tools SIP Generation Fairfax is designed to prepare Fairfax-specific SIPs for ingestion into the Rosetta
archiving system. Its purpose is to automate the generation of Fairfax SIPs from Fairfax files.

What it is *NOT*

History
=======

The National Library of New Zealand has a legal mandate, and a social responsibility, to preserve New Zealand's social
and cultural history, be it in the form of books, newspapers and photographs, or of websites, blogs and videos.
Increasing amounts of New Zealand's documentary heritage is only available online. Users find this content valuable and
convenient, but its impermanence, lack of clear ownership, and dynamic nature pose significant challenges to any
institution that attempts to acquire and preserve it.

NLNZ Tools SIP Generation Fairfax is a set of functionality for use in ingesting Fairfax-specific content. This
*fairfax* ingestion, which is a feed from Fairfax of their digital print publications. This code does the custom
processing involved with processing the Fairfax files.

Project objectives
------------------

-   Meets the needs of the National Library of New Zealand
-   Possibly provide helpful functionality or example processing to other users and institutions.

The tool is open-source software and is freely available for the benefit of the international archiving community.


Documentation corrections
=========================

This documentation is generated from ``.rst`` files in the ``docs`` folder of the codebase, found at
https://github.com/NLNZDigitalPreservation/nlnz-tools-sip-generation-fairfax . However, it is expected that some users
might not be willing to edit those files directly and submit changes via git. Another way to document desired changes
in the documentation is to download the documentation as a ``pdf`` from its location on readthedocs, namely,
https://nlnz-tools-sip-generation-fairfax.readthedocs.io , annotate that pdf with the desired changes, and then
submit that annotated pdf in a github request to change the documentation.
